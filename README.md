# Java-AESEncryption
This program is an implementation of AES Encryption / Decryption, including Codebook generation and secure Password Based Encryption. <br />
Using the Java Cryptography Extension and a GUI built using JavaFX, <br />
Supporting key bit lengths of 128 bits and 256 bits. <br />
<br />

<br />
Future Updates:<br />
<br />

- [x] A completed task  
- [x] Functionality for AES Key Generation using secure random or Password Based Encryption.
- [x] Selection of desired Key Generation Length of 128 or 256 bits.
- [x] Automated Initialisation Vector Generation in a secure manner and prepending to ciphertext.
- [x] AES Encryption using 128 bit or 256 bit keys.
- [x] AES Decryption using 128 bit or 256 bit keys.
- [x] AES Codebook Generation for any selectable month of the year, a unique key for each day at the users desired key length of either 128 bits or 256 bits, each key is generated using a secure method.
- [x] A user friendly GUI interface for all your encryption needs!
